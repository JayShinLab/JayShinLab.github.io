Welcome to the Lab of Regulatory Genomics.

The 98% of the human genome is non-coding and was once considered ‘junk’ but we now know that they play a critical role in human development and disease. Identifying and controlling these non-coding regulatory elements create untapped opportunities for precision medicine, clinical diagnosis and medical interventions. Specifically, the lab decodes the genome by developing break-through genomic technologies and expandable automations for large-scale assays. By combining experimental and computational approaches, the lab uncovers non-coding DNA and RNA elements in cancer and target them based on next-generation therapeutics including nucleic acids and genome-editing tools.

The lab actively participates in the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and FANTOM consortiums, creating possibilities to engage with the global community to illuminate noncoding regulatory elements in disease.
